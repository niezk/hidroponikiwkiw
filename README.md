# 💧 Hydroponic
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using mineral-rich water solutions to deliver nutrients directly to the roots. Plants are supported by a growing medium like rockwool, clay pellets, or coconut fiber, and receive the necessary minerals, water, and oxygen to grow. This soil-free system allows for controlled, efficient growth, often resulting in faster-growing plants and the ability to cultivate them year-round or in non-traditional locations. 

While there's so many  IoT project that inspired us to integrate Hydroponic with ESP32, by using Blynk we can monitoring and control the Vitamin & pH automation. There's so many benefit for us from IoT, We can monitoring from online and make it easier and efficient for Hydroponic to grow than the conventional method.
